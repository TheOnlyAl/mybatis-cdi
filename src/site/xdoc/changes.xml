    <section name="Breaking changes since beta4">
      <p>
        In order to make this module more CDI friendly, the <code>@Mapper</code> interface
        was moved to the Mapper interfaces itself and a new annotation <code>@SessionFactoryProvider</code>
        is now mandatory for SqlSessionFactory producers.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <code>@Mapper</code> annotation is now mandatory in Mapper Interfaces and forbidden in injection points.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>@SessionFactoryProvider</code> is now mandatory in SqlSessionFactory producers.
        </li>
