    <section name="Injecting MyBatis beans">
      
    <subsection name="Selecting the Factory">
      <p>
        In base MyBatis, the <code>SqlSessionFactory</code> is built using <code>SqlSessionFactoryBuilder</code>. 
        In MyBatis-CDI it is produced by any bean with a method annotated with <code>@Produces</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        MyBatis-CDI lets you have more than one <code>SqlSessionFactory</code> and you can choose the one you want to use
        in any injection point by using:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>One or more qualifiers</li>
        <li>The name of the <code>SqlSessionFactory</code></li>
        <li>Any paranoic combination or both</li>
      </ul>
	</subsection>      
      
    <subsection name="Selecting a Factory by using qualifiers">
      
      <p>
        If you have more than one <code>SqlSessionFactory</code>s you can differentiate them by adding qualifiers as you would
        do with any other CDI bean:
      </p>

        <source><![CDATA[
@ApplicationScoped  
@Produces
@OneQualifier
public SqlSessionFactory createManagerOne() throws IOException {
  ...
}
  
@ApplicationScoped
@Produces
@OtherQualifier
public SqlSessionFactory createManagerTwo() throws IOException {
  ...
}]]></source>
    
      <p>
        Now that there is no ambiguity you can select what factory you want to inject to a bean by adding the qualifiers to it:
      </p>
    
        <source><![CDATA[
@Inject @Mapper @OneQualifier private UserMapper userMapper;
]]></source>    
    </subsection>
      
    <subsection name="Selecting a Factory by its name">
    
      <p>
        You can also give a name to your <code>SqlSessionFactory</code> and refer to it by its name in a injection point:
      </p>

        <source><![CDATA[
@ApplicationScoped
@Produces
@Named("fooManager")
public SqlSessionFactory createManager() throws IOException {
  ...
}
]]></source>
      
      <p>And inject it as follows:
      </p>
      
        <source><![CDATA[
@Inject @Mapper @Named("fooManager") private UserMapper userMapper;
]]></source>    
      
      </subsection>
      
    <subsection name="Injecting an SqlSession">

	  <p>You can also inject an <code>SqlSession</code> by requesting its injection as follows:</p>
	  
        <source><![CDATA[
@Inject private SqlSession sqlSession;
]]></source>    

	  <p>The factory selection criteria we saw for mappers apply also to <code>SqlSession</code> injection.</p>
	  
      <p><span class="label important">NOTE</span>
        MyBatis-CDI controls the lifecycle of the injected <code>SqlSession</code> so you must not call any transactional method
        like <code>commit()</code> or <code>rollback()</code>, nor any lifecycle method like <code>close()</code>.
      </p>
	  
	</subsection>
